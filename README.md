# MineSweeper

<p>
My first personal project, built in 10 days.

During the time I was making the game I had seen my self against a lot of challenges, always needing to reinvent my self, finding creatives solutions to finish the project as god as it could be.
<p/>

## How to iniciate the project

° open a directory in your terminal </br>
° git clone https://github.com/GustavoDimeira/MineSweeper.git</br>
° cd MineSweeper</br>
° npm install</br>
° npm start</br>

## Technologies used

TypeScript - React

## Featrues:
º Optimizated functions, making the game run as fluid as possible.

º A very sensitive resize function, able to rezise the board size in every dificulty, making so the board will always fit on the screen size.

° The game define the board's bombs after your first click, making so it will always be in an empty cell.

º Over 150 code's line just for functions.

º Developed on React, using TypeScript

## This is one of many projects that I pretend to make for my portfolio.
